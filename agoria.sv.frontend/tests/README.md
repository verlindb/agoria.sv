- **Cross-browser Testing:** Runs on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit

## üìä Running Specific Tests

Run individual test suites:
```bash
# Dashboard tests only
npx playwright test dashboard.spec.ts

# Companies functionality
npx playwright test companies.spec.ts company-edit-comprehensive.spec.ts

# Technical units management
npx playwright test technical-units.spec.ts technical-unit-detail.spec.ts

# LocalStorage environment tests
npx playwright test localstorage.spec.ts

# MCP Enhanced CRUD tests (NEW)
npm run test:crud-mcp

# Advanced MCP scenarios (NEW)
npm run test:advanced-mcp

# Integration workflow MCP tests (NEW)
npm run test:workflow-mcp

# All MCP tests together (NEW)
npm run test:mcp-suite

# With specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# In headed mode (visible browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Generate and view report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

## üîç Test Results & Debugging

- **HTML Report:** Generated automatically with test results
- **Screenshots:** Captured on test failures
- **Video Recordings:** Available for failed tests
- **Traces:** Full interaction traces for debugging

View the report:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Browser Installation Issues
If browser installation fails:
```bash
# Try alternative download host
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=https://github.com/microsoft/playwright npx playwright install

# Or use Docker
docker run --rm -it mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.55.0-focal
```

### Development Server Issues
Ensure the dev server is running on port 3000:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Check that `.env` file contains:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:3000
VITE_USE_API=false
```
